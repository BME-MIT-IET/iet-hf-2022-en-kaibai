## Task 3 : Creating or extending unit tests

In this project, the unit test for Model, Properties, Query, Stored is done by the original developer, so my task is testing the OWL files in Semantics part.

Because the original developer has done a lot of work, in order to keep the project file in a consistent format, I choose to use Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting as the test tool.

In this task, I have learned how to use Visual Studio 2022 to unit test dot net 6.0 projects, and understand the purpose and significance of unit testing, and realize the importance of unit testing. And learn to use DataRow and DynamicData to simulate input data.

Through my assignments, I completed a total of 16 successful unit tests for the project code and tests for eight different classes. Successfully verified the correct operation of this part of the code. Helps improve the quality and reliability of the code.
