Task 4 : Measuring code coverage for tests and extending test suite based on the results
Firstly, I need to install the suitable measuring tool for the code coverage.

I initially want to use the OpenCover for the project. But I can't find the OpenCover UI in the Marketplace of visual studio 2022. In order to discover the reason, I search Github issue of the author of OpenCover on the internet. I realized that the OpenCover tool only support until Visual Studio 2015. Due to the stituation, I change the tool to the Fine Code Coverage. After the  testing, I also finish the 2 unit tests for the project which contain one classes.

From the task, I have learned how to use Visual Studio 2022 to measuring the code Coverage of the porject. Base on the result, I can do unit tests furthermore which contain the specific classes due to more reliable project.

Through my assignments, I check the code coverage for the initial part and the part from other group members' works. I complete two successful unit tests which involved on test class.
