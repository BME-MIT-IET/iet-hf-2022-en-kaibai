# Task 3-b : Creating or extending unit tests of SKOS & check code coverage SKOS
In this project, the unit test for Model, Properties, Query, Stored is done by the original developer, so my task is testing the SKOS files in Semantics part.

I choose to use Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting as the test tool to keep the convention from the originial developer. And fine code coverage to test the coverage of unit test.

In this task, I have learned how to use Visual Studio 2022 to unit test dot net 6.0 projects, and understand the purpose and significance of unit testing, and realize the importance of unit testing. And learn to initialize testing data. Find code coverage tool to test code coverge.

Through my assignments, I completed a total of 9 successful unit tests for the SKOS test and tests for 5 different classes. Successfully verified the correct operation of this part of the code. Helps improve the quality and reliability of the code. And test the code coverage of SKOS in semantic file.
