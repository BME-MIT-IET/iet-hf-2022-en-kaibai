## RDFSharp

RDFSharp has a modular API made up of 4 layers: RDFSharp.Model, RDFSharp.Store, RDFSharp.Query and RDFSharp.Semantics.

Through this project, we can easily create the RDFModel we need in our own project, and store and query the Model we created. And we can also create and manage our own OWL-DL ontologies through this project, and implement SWRL reasoners on our own ontologies.So this is a very helpful multi-layered API. Our team decided to perform CI and static analysis on the entire project, focusing on unit testing and code coverage analysis for Semantics.
